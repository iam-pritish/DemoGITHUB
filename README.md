# DemoGITHUB
In this repository we push the flie name 'gitdemo.py' form the folder of local system

While doing that, we have to initiate the 'git file' into the folder "DemoGITHUB" in local system.
By using command 'git init'

then, check the Status of the file using "git status"---> which shows 'Un-stage' status 

To change that, we have to add all the folder containt but command using "git add ." <--- Here '.' dot as all files in the folder. and now it's change to 'Stage'.

Now register the Commit by using "git commit -m "Message" "

Then create a Connection with Github Repository using "git remote add origin path_of_GitHub_Repository"

Here (master) and (main) both are same. But ypu have to change master to main or vise-versa use command "git branch -M main" or "git branch -M master" .

Now Up-load the file from local System to Github repository use command "git push origin master-or-main". It will upload the file to the github repo.
